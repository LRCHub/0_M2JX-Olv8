A feather in your cap, an indent on your pillow
Something you can brag about to all your friends, yeah
A feather in your cap, a notch upon your bedpost, yeah
How did I compare? Marks out of ten?
A feather in your cap, a shining badge of honour
A tasty little snack to have between your meals, yeah
A name that you can add to your list of lovers
I only wish you had informed me of the deal

And though it hurts like hell it's not the end of the world
I won't come beating down your door
I should have known that you were only after one thing
I just expected something more
I hope that you'll forgive me if the next time we meet
I don't pretend to be okay
And if it makes you feel uncomfortable
You can always walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

A feather in your cap, a footnote in your memoir
A holiday snap at the bottom of a drawer, yeah
That one day you'll look at with just a tinge of sorrow
Throw it in the trash and get yourself a beer
