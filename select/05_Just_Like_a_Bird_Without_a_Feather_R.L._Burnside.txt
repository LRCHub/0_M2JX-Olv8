Just like a bird without a feather
You know I'm lost without your love
Just like a bird without a feather
You know I'm lost without your love
You know I need your loving
Just like an angel needs heaven above
Yeah I shot that woman
Shot her cause she done me wrong
Yeah, I love that woman
Said she ain't love no one but me
But I caught that woman cheatin'
Now my home ain't where it used to be
