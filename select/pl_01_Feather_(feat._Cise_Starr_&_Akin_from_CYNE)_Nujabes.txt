Light as a feather when I'm
floating through
Reading through the daily news
Measuring the hurt within the
golden rule
Centimeters in ether I'm heatin'
the speaker
Motivational teacher with words
that burn people
Seeing the headlines lined
with discord
It's either genocide or the
planet in uproar
Never good, the rules of
paradise are never nice
The best laid plans of mice and
men are never right
I'm just a vagabond with flowers
for Algernon
An average joe who knows what
the fuck is goin' on
It's the hope of my thoughts
that I travel upon
Fly like an arrow of God until
I'm gone so
Driftin' away like a
feather in air
Lettin' my words take me away
from the hurt and despair
So I'm keepin' it vertical
forever elevator
Riding an escalator to a
somethin' that is greater
so I'm
Driftin' away like a
feather in air
Lettin' my soul take me away
from the hurt and despair
So I'm keepin' it vertical
forever elevator
Riding an escalator to a
somethin' that is greater
Taking chances word tap dancing
with wolves
In an ice arena out there deep
in the woods of Arizona
The sun be high life's ironic
Ain't I tryin' to be Dali
when I write
Surreal life I paint it vivid
Habitat, crazy, insane
Watchin' propaganda six o' clock
news that are sayin
Cultures clash, poor black folk
and white trash
They rebel in the cyberspace
that might crash, dash
To millennium a million miles
of runnin
At the speed of now back,no
return gunnin
Rambo style gun-ho child gunning
Ammo blaow two times loud
stunnin, stunning
When it hit ya, lift ya off the
earth like
Ayo take you right back to
birth, and
Niggas wonder why
They might wonder why this shit
might happen but it does,
it goes
Driftin' away like a
feather in air
Lettin' my words take me away
from the hurt and despair
So I'm keepin' it vertical
forever elevator
Riding the escalator to a
somethin' that is greater
so I'm
Driftin' away like a
feather in air
Lettin' my soul take me away
from the hurt and despair
So I'm keepin' it vertical
forever elevator
Riding the escalator to a
somethin' that is greater
Treat you, better than me 'cause
that's the heavenly key
To unlock the inner strength
where my essence will be
It's the knowledge of self,
understanding of the things
around me
That becomes the wisdom
that I need,
Livin' this life to the best of
my ability
Channelin' energy to my thoughts
attain symmetry
Remember me, because my prose
remain gold
I got the gift of gab like them
pimps in Kangols
It never ends, I keep it rollin'
like a cypher,
The first cave man bringing
fire, innovating it higher
To blast mistakes
I raise the stakes
It's double or nothing in this
vacuum of space
I will, survive, divine,
the time to cry
Fuck a hold or hide I'm alive
with pride
And I drove the chevy to the
levy but the levy was dry
Singing "this will be the day
that I die"
