```lrc
[00:11.77] Light as a feather
[00:12.95] When i'm floatin through
[00:13.80] Readin through the daily news
[00:14.73] Measuring the hurt within the golden rule
[00:16.54] Centimetres of ether i'm heatin the speaker
[00:19.26] Motivational teacher with words that burn people
[00:22.29] Seeing the headlines lined with discord
[00:24.58] It's either genocide, all the planet in uproar
[00:27.10] Never good but rules of paradise are never nice
[00:29.99] The best laid plan of mice and men are never right
[00:32.76] I'm just a vagabond with flowers for algernon
[00:35.14] The average joe who knows what the fuck is goin on
[00:37.99] It's the hope of my thoughts that i travelled upon
[00:40.89] Fly like an arrow of god until i'm gone
[00:43.23] So i'm driftin away like a feather in air
[00:46.30] Lettin my words take me away from the hurt and despair
[00:48.56] So i'm keepin it vertical forever elevator
[01:09.56] 
[00:50.59] Ridin the escalator to the somethin that is greater
[00:53.27] So i'm driftin away like a feather in air
[00:56.09] Lettin my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
[00:58.74] So i'm keepin it vertical forever elevator
[01:01.50] Ridin the escalator to the somethin that is greater
[01:04.22] Taking chances
[01:05.29] Word tap dancing with wolves
[01:06.71] In an ice arena out there, deep in the woods of arizona
[01:34.21] 
[01:10.02] The sun be high, life's ironic
[01:25.02] 
[01:12.40] Aint tryin to be talib when i write
[01:14.23] Surreal life i paint it vivid habitat crazy insane
[01:17.25] Watch the propaganda 6 o'clock news that are saying
[01:20.00] Cultures clash for black folk and white trash
[01:22.62] They revel in the cyberspace that might crash
[01:25.32] Dash to millineum a million miles of runnin
[01:28.25] At the speed of now back don't return gunnin
[01:31.02] Rambo style gunho child gunnin
[01:33.56] Ammo blao two times loud stunnin
[01:36.60] Stunnin when i hit ya lift you off the earth like
[01:39.29] Ayo take you right back to birth
[01:41.65] And niggaz wonder why they might wonder why
[01:44.58] This shit might happen but it does, they go
[01:47.59] Driftin away like a feather in air
[01:49.35] Lettin my words take me away from the hurt and despair
[01:52.14] So i'm keepin it vertical forever elevator
[02:13.14] 
[01:54.74] Ridin the escalator to the somethin that is greater
[01:57.34] So i'm driftin away like a feather in air
[02:17.84] 
[01:59.74] Lettin my soul take me away from the hurt and despair
[02:02.78] So i'm keepin it vertical forever elevator
[02:05.44] Ridin the escalator to the somethin that is greater
[02:08.11] Treat you better than me
[02:09.57] Because that's the heavenly key
[02:10.63] To unlock the inner strength
[02:24.63] 
[02:12.13] Where my essence will be
[02:13.34] It's the knowledge of self
[02:14.76] Understanding of the things around me
[02:33.26] 
[02:16.37] That becomes the wisdom that i need
[02:18.69] Living this life to the best of my ability
[02:21.29] Channelling energy to my thoughts into your symmetry
[02:24.02] Remember me because my clothes remain gold
[02:26.82] I got the gift of gab like them pimps in kangols
[02:29.38] It never ends i keep it rulin like a cypher
[02:31.99] The first caveman bringin fire
[02:34.10] Innovating and higher to blast mistakes i raise the stakes
[02:37.41] It's double or nothing in this vaccuum-less space
[02:40.17] I will survive, divine the time to cry fuck a hold or hide i'm alive with pride
[02:44.93] And i drove the chevy to the levy
[02:47.06] But the levy was dry singin "this will be the day that i die"
